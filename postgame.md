# My Pitcher Post-Outing Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I was able to craft a report that analyzes a pitcher's outing.

## Project Description

This report was created with the goal of evaluating a pitcher's outing. The report includes a table with the number of pitches, batters faced, SO, BB, H, XBH, Max Velo, Whiffs, Strike%, CSW%, pitch win performance in 3-2 and 1-1 counts, and negative to positive transitions. There is also a page with usages, pitch metrics including velocity, spin, extension, break, tilt, VAA (adjusted to be in different parts of the zone depending on the pitch type), release point, and an arm angle approximation based on the pitcher's height and their release point). It also includes a pitch movement plot (with arm angles) and a release point plot. The next page then has a results table (zone%, chase%, batted ball results such as groundballs or linedrives, etc). There is also a comparison table that shows important pitch metrics, realease attributes, and results stats which shows you the differences in these values between this outing and the pitcher's last 5 appearances. There are then pages for pitch locations and whiff locations respectively. Matchups are then broken down pitch by pitch, each batter getting their own page which breaks down each of their plate appearances pitch by pitch with results and pitch metrics. The attached report is a post-outing report for Aaron Savary's outing for Iowa on May 24th, 2025.

### Pitcher Evaluation Analysis
In this project, I wrote code in R to create a report analyzing a pitcher and their stuff when given Trackman data.
