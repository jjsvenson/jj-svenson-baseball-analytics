# My Pitcher Season Performance Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I was able to craft a report that analyzes a pitcher's season and how they are pitched vs specific teams.

## Project Description

This report was created with the goal of evaluating a pitcher's season and performance against different teams. The report includes a table with the number of pitches, batters faced, SO, BB, H, XBH, Max Velo, Whiffs, Strike%, CSW%, pitch win performance in 3-2 and 1-1 counts, and negative to positive transitions. There is also a table with usages and pitch metrics including velocity, spin, extension, break, tilt, VAA (adjusted to be in different parts of the zone depending on the pitch type), release point, and an arm angle approximation based on the pitcher's height and their release point. There is also a results table (zone%, chase%, batted ball results such as groundballs or linedrives, etc). It also includes a pitch movement plot (with arm angles) and a release point plot. There are then pages for pitch locations and whiff locations respectively. Matchups are then broken down batter by batter and team by team, each team getting their own page which breaks down each of their player's overall performance vs the given pitcher this season. The attached report is a season performance report for Iowa baseball's Reece Beuter.
