# My Hitter Evaluation Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I aimed to make a report that analyzed hitters.

## Project Description

When coding my hitter evaluation report, I wanted to use R to read a Trackman CSV and display statistics and plots indicating a hitter's success. In the reportâ€™s creation, I cared about looking at exit velocity, launch angle, contact, hard hits, whiff, in-zone whiff, and chase. Specifically with exit velocities and launch angles, I find it useful to look at their complete distributions rather than only their averages. For example, with launch angles, a lot of ground balls and pop flies could result in a line drive average launch angle, even if the hitter does not hit a lot of line drives. Therefore, I have displayed the distributions of exit velocity and launch angle, including quartiles. I have also plotted exit velocity against launch angle so I can see how hard each hitter hits the ball with respect to different launch angles. Here is the outputted PDF of my report.

### Hitter Evaluation
In this project, I used n R to code a report evaluating a hitter's performance.
