# My Hitter Evaluation Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I aimed to make a report that analyzed hitters.

## Project Description

When coding my hitter evaluation report, I wanted to use R to read a Trackman CSV and display statistics and plots indicating a hitter's success. In the reportâ€™s creation, I cared about looking at exit velocity, launch angle, contact, hard hits, whiff, in-zone whiff, and chase. Specifically with exit velocities and launch angles, I find it useful to look at their complete distributions rather than only their averages. For example, with launch angles, a lot of ground balls and pop flies could result in a line drive average launch angle, even if the hitter does not hit a lot of line drives. Therefore, I have displayed the distributions of exit velocity and launch angle, including quartiles. I have also plotted exit velocity against launch angle so I can see how hard each hitter hits the ball with respect to different launch angles. The following output is for the Arizona Wildcat's 2024 season but my code works with any Trackman csv!

### Hitter Evaluation
In this project, I used n R to code a report evaluating a hitter's performance.
