# My Pitcher Evaluation Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I was able to craft a report that analyzes pitchers.

## Project Description

This report was created with the goal of evaluating a pitcher and his stuff. The report includes a table with usages, pitch metrics including velocity, spin, extension, break, tilt, VAA (adjusted to be in different parts of the zone depending on the pitch type), release point, and an arm angle approximation based on the pitcher's height and their release point), and results. It also includes a pitch movement plot (with arm angles), a release point plot, and general location plots and whiff specific plots split by pitch type. The attached report includes all of the data from the 2025 Iowa baseball season but the code can be used to analyze any Trackman data.

### Pitch Sequencing Analysis
In this project, I created code in R to create a report analyzing pitch sequencing when given a Trackman CSV.
