# Welcome to JJ Svenson's Baseball Analytics Page

Hi, I'm **JJ Svenson**, a third year Statistics and Data Science major at UCLA with a passion for data analytics. On this website, I showcase my baseball analytics projects, where I combine my knowledge in statistics and data science with my love for baseball to investigate statistics relating to player performance.

## My Projects

Here are my projects:

### [Pitch Sequencing Analysis](#)
In this project, I created code in R to create a report analyzing pitch sequencing when given a Trackman csv.
