# My Pitch Similarity Report

Using R as a tool and Trackman CSVs as my data, I was able to craft a report that analyzes the results of all NCAA pitches with similar shape/metrics to a target pitcher's pitches.

## Project Description

This report was created with the goal of evaluating a pitcher and how his stuff performs across NCAA baseball. The report includes a table for each pitch type a pitcher throws, split by batter handedness, detailing the results of all pitches within +/- 1.5 inches of induced vertical break (IVB) and horizontal break (HB), +/- 1 mph of velocity, and +/- 3 inches of release height and release side (release point metrics). The tables include counts (# of pitches), swing %, swing % for pitches in the zone, whiff %, whiff % for pitches in the zone, chase %, swinging strike %, called strike + whiff (CSW) %, ball in play %, out % for balls in play, ground ball %, line drive %, fly ball %, pop up %, bullet % (where a bullet is defined as any ball in play between 0ยบ and 40ยบ of launch angle with an exit velocity of 90 mph or more), average exit velocity, and average launch angle. The attached report includes all of the data from the 2025 Iowa baseball season but the code can be used to analyze any Trackman data.

### Pitcher Evaluation Analysis
In this project, I wrote code in R to create a report analyzing a pitcher and their stuff when given a Trackman CSV.
